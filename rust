🧰 rustfmt

rustfmt is a tool that formats Rust code according to the official Rust style guidelines.

Keeps your code clean, readable, and consistent across projects.

🧱 cargo fmt

cargo fmt runs rustfmt on your entire project.

Automatically formats all .rs files to follow Rust’s standard style rules.

Example:

cargo fmt

⚙️ cargo build

When you type:

cargo build


It means:

“Cargo, please compile my Rust code so I can run it later.”

🧠 Remember These 4 Points

🧩 Compiles your Rust code.

🏗️ Saves the compiled program in target/debug/.

⚡ Used mainly for testing and development.

🧮 Use cargo build --release for a faster, optimized version (for production).

🧰 Other Useful Cargo Commands
Command	What It Does
cargo build	Builds your project only.
cargo run	Builds and runs your project.
cargo check	Quickly checks for errors without building (faster!).
⚙️ The Two Build Modes in Cargo
Mode	Command	When to Use	What It Does
🧱 Debug Mode	cargo build	When writing or testing code	Builds fast, but runs slower.
🚀 Release Mode	cargo build --release	When ready to share or publish	Builds slower, but runs much faster.

🪄 Tip:

Debug mode = for learning and fixing
Release mode = for speed and final use

📦 What is crates.io?

crates.io is like an app store for Rust code.

A website where developers share packages (called crates).

A crate is a library or project that you can reuse.

Cargo automatically downloads crates from crates.io when you build.

Example:

# Cargo.toml
rand = "0.8"


Cargo will go to crates.io, download the rand crate, and include it in your project.

▶️ cargo run & Variants
Command	Description
cargo run	Builds and runs your project (in debug mode).
cargo r	Short form for cargo run.
cargo run --quiet	Runs quietly — hides intermediate build steps.
🏗️ cargo build vs cargo check
Command	Description
cargo build	Builds the executable but does not run it.
cargo check	Only checks for errors — faster, no executable built.
